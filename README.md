# Work in progress.

My plan is to make collection of everything you can mod your 8570w to make it better and last longer.</br>
</br>
### List of TODO:
</br>
-Upgrade GPU</br>
-Upgrade CPU</br>
-Modify and upgrade cooling system</br>
-Upgrade WiFi and Bluetooth</br>
-Add additional SATA3 SSD and NVME drive</br>
-Upgrade fingerprint scanner</br>
-Upgrade LCD to 16:10 </br>
-Modify screen cable (no need to buy rare DC2 assembly)</br>
-Undervolt CPU and GPU</br>
-Overclock RAM </br>
-Upgrade built in audio</br>
-Hardware disable for WWAN slot</br>
-Motherboard patches</br>
-Addditional USB 3.0 ports</br>
-Guides for all above and other things like - how to install driver for upgraded GPU, important BIOS options, how to flash vBIOS, where to look for answers, etc.</br>
</br>
Less important and harder to do:</br>
-UEFI module hacking or installing coreboot</br>
</br>
I already did many of those, only few to go. And step-by-step documentation so anyone can do it, here on github.</br>
You may find me on notebooktalk, 4pda, ibmnb or hpfocus forums. </br>
